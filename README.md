# Mix It Up - WIBDEV Version
This is a old version of document.

A desktop client for handling chat, interactivity, and other streamer assistance features for the Mixer streaming platform.

## What is this?
Mix It Up is striving to be the "one stop shop" for all of your administrative needs when streaming to Mixer. Mix It Up will allow you to handle chat moderation, interactivity, constellation events, and create customized commands that work across chat, interactivity, and constellation events. Channel moderators will also be able to use the app to handle viewing and managing chat for any channel they have authorization for.

## How do I contribute?
Feel free to take a fork of the master branch and start plugging away! This app relies on the https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/mixer-client-csharp client API, which is pre-setup in the solution via NuGet. Once that is done, the solution should be all set to go. Code up some changes/features and submit a pull request at https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/mixer-mixitup/pulls! I'm happy to assist anyone in developing a feature, feel free to shoot me a tweet [@SaviorXTanren](https://twitter.com/SaviorXTanren).
